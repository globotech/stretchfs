OOSE [![Build Status](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/nullivex/oose.svg?token=EgNQpuNvio2L8rSzcEkz&branch=master)](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/nullivex/oose)
========

Object Oriented Storage Engine

## Installation

```
$ git clone git@github.com:nullivex/oose.git
$ cd oose
$ npm install
```

## Starting

First, setup a local config file like so.

```js
'use strict';
module.exports = {
  store: {
    enabled: true
  },
  prism: {
    enabled: true
  }
}
```

Of course any additional overrides can be added to the config here.

Second, start the system.

```
$ node app
```

## Testing

The default test suite can be ran using npm

```
$ npm test
```

For development a more interactive test method might be best

```
$ mocha -R spec --watch
```

## Debugging

All debug logging now uses the [https://github.com/visionmedia/debug](debug)
package.

The following can be used to see all messages (typically used in dev)
```
$ DEBUG=oose:* node app
```

From there follow the debug filtering rules defined
[https://github.com/visionmedia/debug#wildcards](here)

## Changelog

### 2.2.0

* Purchases are once again stored in redis, but this time pointing at a single
HA redis instance.
* Drop bloat from the purchase record.
* Prototype for clone scaling on demand for load reactivity.
* Bump dependencies.

### 2.1.0

* Add CouchDB migration script from 2.0.x
* Change CouchDB key structure to save disk space.

### 2.0.4

* Organize data into separate couchdb databases for better performance
reliability and debugging.
* Add Heartbeat startup delay.

### 2.0.3

* Improve inventory system
* Extract purchase and inventory to script level
* Rebuilt heartbeat system
* Updated dependencies
* Add bubble cache to purchases
* Add bubble cache to content existence

### 2.0.1

* Add inventory driver system
* Abstract native inventory driver from current implementation
* Implement unix high performance driver
* Auto load proper inventory driver

### 2.0.0

* Implement heartbeat system with downvoting to avoid outages
* Move install scripts to the `install` folder
* Move NGINX configuration templates to `install` folder
* Implement Node.JS backed installation script with a bash bootstrap script
* Upgraded all dependencies and Node.js 4.2.x / 5.x compatible.
* Drop master, as being replaced by CouchDB
* Drop redis, as being replaced by CouchDB
* Drop MySQL, as being replaced by CouchDB
* Implement CouchDB for cluster consistency
* Scan content existence directly into CouchDB
* Drop OOSE backed content existence system
* Variable hash typing added the following ciphers are supported
  * sha512
  * sha384
  * sha256
  * sha224
  * sha1
  * md5
* The new variable hashing system defaults to sha1 (to be backwards compatible) this can be changed in the configuration.

### 1.3.0

This version changes the stateless existence system to a more stateful system
powered by the master. Also purchase records are going to be moved to the master
so that prisms cannot lose sync by being rebooted or by outages. This will also
greatly improve the performance of the existence and purchase systems. Which
should increase cluster performance in general.

These changes will not affect any of the client side functionality and will not
break any APIs no require any changes to the SDK.

* Add inventory system to the master to maintain copy of all data on the
cluster.
* Add tests for inventory system.
* Add script to scan store inventory and submit it to master
* Add proactive cache filling of existence on prism from master
* Store purchases on master
* Add tests for purchase system
* Add proactive cache filling of purchase on prism from master
* Drop unused memory system from master

### 1.2.0
* Purchases now require file extension to ensure consistency of purchases.
* File detail can be used to ascertain an unknown mime type from a sha1
* `oose-sdk` 1.2.0 has been released in conjunction with this release.
* All clients that purchase content need to request purchases with file
extension, this is a breaking change.
* Exists now takes timeout and retryCount at call time to ensure that scripts
and other tools that need a higher level of guarantee that content doesnt
exist will get a more reliable result.

### 1.1.0
* Many bug fixes from initial production deployment
* Exists now takes bulk requests with an array of sha1's and is still
backward compatible with singular requests.

* Sessions are now sticky and can be generated through the oose-sdk
* Finished clonetool for managing content cluster wide
* Added storeInventory tool for displaying and repairing store content

* Improve prism query string handling on requests
